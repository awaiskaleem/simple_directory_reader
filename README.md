# File QA Bot
In this project, I tried to create a vector search bot on my local file system.
The code used is from [here](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/data_connectors/simple_directory_reader.html)

## Steps to follow:
1. Grab your OPENAI_API_KEY from openai.com >> API Keys >> Generate Keys
2. Make sure you have pip/python and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Follow cells executions in `simple-directory-reader.ipynb`
